### Who I am and where I am right now

I started coding in 2013, working with C#/Java on desktop. Then I drifted to web a year later learning primary Ruby on Rails and PHP.
Got an internship to work on a Rails-based app and background processing with Sidekiq named Corretagem FÃ¡cil. Left in March 2018 and started studying NodeJS/Angular soon after. Got on FormaTurismo by August and have been ever after. We have a basically JS/TS stack, with Node/Express/Nest on the back-end and Angular on the front end.

### What I am learning at the moment

I always try to improve my skills doing courses and resolving problems. At the moment I'm learning React to start developing some apps with it. Besides that, always studying tools that makes sense to the modern architecture.

### Skills

* Javascript
* Typescript 
* Front-end (Angular and learning React)
* Back-end (APIs, NodeJS)
* Unit Tests (Jest and Jasmine)
* End to End Tests (Cypress)
* SQL
* MongoDB
* Git
* Linux system administration

### Projects

I'm looking for ideas to actually implement a new project soon. Might be starting it soon.
